## Workshop Structure

During this workshop we will create an LLM-powered customer support agent chatbot for a car rental company.
The workshop is divided into 7 steps. 
Each step builds on the previous one, adding new features and functionality.

We start from the base functionality (step 1) and add features in the subsequent steps. 
The result after each step is located in a separate directory (`step-XX`). 
The final solution is in the `step-07` directory.


We recommend to start by checking out the _main_ branch and then opening the project from `step-01` in your IDE and using that directory throughout the workshop. 
The other option is to make a copy of it. 
If you later need to reset to a particular step, either overwrite your working directory with the directory for the step you want to reset to, or, in your IDE, open the project from the step directory you want to reset to.
